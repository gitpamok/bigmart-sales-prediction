# bigmart-sales-prediction
**Problem Definition**
* The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales.

**Business Goal**
* Using this model, it will be possible for Bigmart to understand the properties of products and outlets which in turn, will help in increasing the sales.

**Objective**
* We will build a predictive model using regression techniques to predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
